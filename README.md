Webstrates
==========

With Webstrates, webpages become collaboratively editable in real-time. Changes to the Document Object Model (DOM) of a page persist and are synchronised to all connected clients of the same page using [Operational Transformation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) through [ShareDB](https://github.com/share/sharedb). 

Webstrates can be used to develop interactive software where collaboration-support is the norm rather than the exception.

Go to the [documentation](https://webstrates.github.io) to get started using webstrates, for user guide and developer guide.
